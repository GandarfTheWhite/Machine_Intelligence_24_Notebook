# Machine_Intelligence_24_Notebook
Jupyter notebook for Machine Intelligence Assessment at Bournemouth University, during semester one of 2024-2025 accademic year.

A part of the assigment was to write the python implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the following problem:

Question 1. Genetic algorithms
A small company has 13 employees (E1 â€¦ E13) available for assignment to 10 tasks (see table below). Any person can be assigned to any task and each task requires processing by only one person. The table below shows how well each person performs in each task. For instance, Employee 1 (E1) performs better on Task 1 (T1) then on Task 2 (T2).

T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 T9 T10
E1 55 30 20 20 24 24 18 33 35 29
E2 14 14 22 34 26 19 22 29 22 19
E3 22 16 21 27 35 25 30 22 23 23
E4 17 25 29 26 13 24 25 25 26 18
E5 12 25 27 26 15 24 27 25 26 14
E6 26 29 37 34 37 20 21 25 27 27
E7 30 28 37 28 29 23 19 33 30 21
E8 28 21 25 24 25 20 24 24 30 24
E9 19 18 19 28 25 27 26 32 23 22
E10 30 22 29 19 30 29 29 21 20 28
E11 29 25 35 29 27 28 30 28 19 33
E12 15 19 19 33 22 24 25 31 33 21
E13 25 35 25 32 25 22 29 22 26 31

Implement Python code (with comments) and run your simulation to find the employee-task assignment that produces the best (final) score that should be indicated too.

Results:
Best Solution: [1, 13, 7, 2, 6, 10, 3, 9, 12, 11]
Fitness: 355
